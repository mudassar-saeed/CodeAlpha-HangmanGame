# CodeAlpha-HangmanGame
A simple text-based Hangman game built in Python. The player guesses a hidden word (chosen randomly from a predefined list of 5 words) one letter at a time. The game allows up to 6 incorrect guesses and uses basic console input/output. Key concepts: random, while loop, if-else, strings, and lists.
